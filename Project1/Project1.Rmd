# Overview 

We are given a text file, tournamentinfo.txt, which has a table of data from a chess tournament.  The data includes the 64 contestants' name, state they are from, total points scored, their pre-rating, and the results of the matches of who they played against.  I read the file into R using readLines, then extracted the names, states, points, and pre-ratings using regular expressions and stringr.  To calculate the opponent pre-rating average, I extracted a list of each player's opponents by number.  I then looped through the list, taking the mean of the opponents' pre-rating for each individual player.  I then saved the data frame in csv format as tournamentinfo.csv.
